Archive Index

Purpose
- Keep the repository root tidy while preserving historical notes, prompts, and large sample files.

Structure
- backups/: SQL dumps and legacy backup files (kept for reference).
- samples/: Large media samples not used by the app runtime.
- assorted markdown notes moved from root.

Notable files
- backups/landing_page.dart.bak – old landing page backup.
- backups/wisdom_dump_*.sql – database dumps used during migration troubleshooting.
- samples/* – big demo files (e.g., MP4) safe to remove if storage is constrained.

Guidance
- Prefer adding new long-form notes under docs/ rather than repo root.
- If a root note becomes outdated, move it here instead of deleting outright.
