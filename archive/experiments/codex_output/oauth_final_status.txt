FOUND issues:
- auth.users had 139 users with NULL aud/role; OAuth confirmation defaults missing for live env fallback
- Env files lacked synchronized OAuth redirect entries and production/live stubs; CORS headers/methods were restricted

FIXED issues:
- Set aud/role to 'authenticated' for 139 auth.users rows; verified no orphaned OAuth users/zombies
- Supabase Google provider already allowed http://localhost:4003/login-callback and https://aveli.app/login-callback (no patch needed)
- Added OAUTH_REDIRECT_WEB_PROD plus dev/live env files (backend/.env, backend/.env.local, frontend/.env.dev, frontend/.env.live) and updated existing envs
- EnvResolver now defaults to https redirect when APP_ENV=live; dev/test stays on localhost
- CORS now allows credentials with all headers/methods to support Supabase session return

Remaining manual tasks:
- Ensure production deployments inject full env/secret set with APP_ENV=live and OAUTH_REDIRECT_WEB=https://aveli.app/login-callback
- Run a full Google OAuth login in the app/web to confirm session exchange with the backend

Google login ready for test: YES
